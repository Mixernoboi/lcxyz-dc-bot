# lcxyz-dc-bot
my discord bot (LCXYZ Stats Bot#2331) bot code 

you need a mongodb database on port 27017 (localhost too!) with discord-bot database and inside that: collections named like this: channels, guilds, stat_leaderboard, stat_pings_extra_info, stats_pings, users    
(if you just want to test without modifying the files) 

nodejs v16 is what i use, no idea if this works for other versions.


ALSO REPLACE THE FILE env WITH .env TY!!

also this is using banner.yt :)
